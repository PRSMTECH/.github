- GitHub repositories and discussions
- Code reviews and pull requests
- Issue trackers
- Project documentation
- Team communication channels
- Events (virtual and in-person)
- Official social media accounts
- Email communications

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces, such as using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an event.

## Enforcement
